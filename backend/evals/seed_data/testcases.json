In your explanation, describe the difference between saying the electron goes through both slits and saying it is described by a probability distribution prior to detection. Address how this experiment challenges classical assumptions about particles having definite positions and trajectories at all times. Avoid focusing on philosophical interpretations; instead, explain the physical setup and the mechanism by which interference patterns arise and disappear when detectors are introduced.",
