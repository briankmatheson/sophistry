    "title": "Nostalgia and Franchise Reboots",
    "prompt": "Over the past two decades, Hollywood has increasingly relied on rebooting, remaking, or extending franchises from previous eras rather than investing in original stories. Studios argue that known intellectual property reduces financial risk because audiences already have emotional attachments to familiar characters and worlds. Critics counter that this cycle starves original storytelling of funding and reduces cultural novelty. Audiences often express fatigue with reboots yet continue to buy tickets for them, creating a paradox where stated preferences and actual behavior diverge. Why do studios keep rebooting old franchises instead of investing in original stories, and what does this pattern reveal about how audiences relate to familiarity versus novelty?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "studios reboot franchises because familiar IP reduces financial risk, but this creates a feedback loop where original stories struggle for funding, revealing that nostalgia functions as cultural insurance that can stifle creative innovation"

    "prompt": "Internet memes are images, phrases, or video clips that spread rapidly across online communities, mutating as they travel. A single meme template can carry vastly different meanings depending on the community using it, the text overlaid on it, and the cultural moment in which it appears. Some memes persist for years and become part of everyday digital vocabulary, while others vanish within days.

In what ways do memes function as a form of language, and why do some memes endure across communities while others disappear almost immediately?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "memes function like language by carrying shared meaning through culturally recognized symbols whose interpretation depends on context, and they endure when their template is flexible enough to adapt to new situations while rigid memes tied to one moment fade"

Psychologists call these parasocial relationships: one-sided bonds where a viewer or listener feels genuine intimacy, trust, and loyalty toward a media figure. The phenomenon has intensified with social media and streaming, where creators speak directly to cameras and share personal details, creating an illusion of mutual friendship. These bonds are not always harmful, but they can blur the line between connection and consumption. What are parasocial relationships, and why can they feel so emotionally real even though the connection only flows in one direction?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "parasocial relationships are one-sided emotional bonds that feel real because consistent media exposure builds familiarity patterns similar to genuine acquaintance, though the intimacy is illusory since the public figure has no reciprocal connection"

These algorithms optimize for engagement, meaning they tend to surface content similar to what a user has already consumed. Over time, this creates increasingly narrow consumption patterns sometimes called filter bubbles.

Supporters argue it is a democratized form of accountability that gives marginalized voices power against those who previously faced no consequences. Critics argue it often bypasses due process, collapses context, and punishes disproportionately because social media compresses judgment into hours. The same mechanism can serve both genuine justice and mob dynamics depending on the situation. How does the process of online cancellation typically unfold, and why is it so difficult to determine whether it functions as legitimate accountability or as disproportionate collective punishment?",

Why does fandom become a component of personal identity for some people, and what happens psychologically when the object of that fandom changes or disappoints them?",
    "expected": {

This result, known as the halting problem, is foundational to computer science because it establishes a hard boundary on what computation can achieve. The proof works by assuming such a universal halting detector exists and then constructing a contradiction, similar to classical diagonal arguments in mathematics. What is the halting problem, why did Turing prove it is unsolvable, and what does this impossibility result tell us about the fundamental limits of computation?",

More broadly, the mere existence of convincing deepfake technology undermines trust in all recorded media, because any genuine recording can now be dismissed as fabricated. This creates what researchers call the liar's dividend: guilty parties can claim authentic evidence against them is fake. How do deepfakes threaten institutional trust, what is the liar's dividend, and why are technical solutions like detection algorithms and watermarking unlikely to fully solve the problem?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "deepfakes threaten trust by making all recorded evidence dismissible as potentially fabricated, creating a liar's dividend where guilty parties claim authentic evidence is fake, and technical solutions are insufficient because detection is an arms race and the damage to epistemic trust is social rather than purely technical"

    "prompt": "The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno proposed a series of paradoxes about motion and infinity. In one famous version, the swift Achilles races a tortoise that has a head start. Before Achilles can overtake the tortoise, he must first reach the point where the tortoise was when he started. But by then, the tortoise has moved slightly ahead. Achilles must now reach that new point, but again the tortoise has advanced. This creates an infinite sequence of catching-up steps, each shorter than the last, but always leaving a gap. Common sense tells us Achilles obviously passes the tortoise, yet the logical argument seems to prove he cannot. What is Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, why does it seem logically compelling despite being obviously wrong, and how do modern mathematical concepts resolve it?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "Zeno's paradox seems compelling because it correctly identifies an infinite sequence of steps but incorrectly assumes infinite steps require infinite time, and modern calculus resolves it by showing that an infinite series can converge to a finite sum, meaning Achilles does overtake the tortoise in finite time"

This reasoning seems valid at every step: removing one grain from a heap cannot destroy its heap-ness. Yet if you continue applying this logic, you eventually reach one grain of sand, and surely one grain is not a heap. This is the Sorites paradox, or the paradox of the heap, and it challenges our ability to draw sharp boundaries for vague concepts. What is the Sorites paradox, why does it resist straightforward resolution, and what does it reveal about how human language handles vague categories?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "the Sorites paradox shows that vague concepts like heap have no sharp boundary where they stop applying, each individual step of removing a grain seems valid but the cumulative conclusion is absurd, revealing that natural language relies on fuzzy categories that resist precise logical formalization"

You may take both boxes or only Box B. Here is the twist: the predictor has already made a prediction about your choice. If the predictor predicted you would take only Box B, they placed one million dollars inside it. If they predicted you would take both boxes, they left Box B empty. The prediction is already made and cannot change. Should you take only Box B, trusting the predictor's accuracy, or take both boxes, reasoning that the million is either already there or not? Why does this problem split rational people into opposing camps?",

If your parent was never born, then you were never born, which means you never traveled back in time, which means your grandfather did meet your grandmother after all, which means you were born and did travel back.

The prisoner reasons backward: it cannot be Friday, because if he survives until Thursday evening, Friday would be the only option left and thus not a surprise. Eliminating Friday, it cannot be Thursday either, for the same reasoning. Continuing this logic, the prisoner eliminates every day and concludes he cannot be hanged at all. On Wednesday, the executioner arrives, and the prisoner is genuinely surprised. What is the unexpected hanging paradox, where does the prisoner's seemingly valid reasoning go wrong, and what does it reveal about the relationship between logical deduction and knowledge?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "the prisoner's backward elimination reasoning seems valid at each step but produces a false conclusion because the act of concluding no hanging is possible restores the possibility of surprise, revealing that self-referential reasoning about one's own future knowledge can be subtly incoherent"

This occurs because individual drivers making locally rational choices about which route to take can produce a collectively worse outcome when a new shortcut is available. Each driver switches to the apparently faster route, but the resulting congestion makes the entire network slower than before the road was built. This paradox has been observed in real road networks and also applies to electrical circuits and internet routing. What is Braess's paradox, why does adding capacity sometimes make things worse, and what does it reveal about the difference between individual and collective rationality?",

In fact, in a group of just 23 people, there is a greater than 50 percent chance that at least two people share a birthday. With 70 people, the probability exceeds 99.9 percent. This result surprises most people because they confuse the probability of someone sharing their specific birthday with the probability of any two people in the group sharing any birthday.

Why does the birthday problem produce a result that feels so counterintuitive, and what mathematical principle explains why the threshold is so much lower than people expect?",
    "expected": {
      "answer": "the birthday problem is counterintuitive because people confuse the chance of matching a specific birthday with the chance of any pair matching, and the actual threshold is low because the number of possible pairs grows quadratically with group size, making a collision likely much sooner than linear intuition suggests"

Most people's intuition says it does not matter whether you switch, because there are two doors left and the car is equally likely to be behind either one.
